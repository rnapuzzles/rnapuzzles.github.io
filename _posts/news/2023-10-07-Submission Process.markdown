We have updated the data submission process for the RNA Puzzles. The Automated web server mandates a 48-hour window, while human expert submissions span 3~4 weeks. Unlike previous systems, current protocols permit up to five model submissions per prediction method, and a single team can proffer multiple predictive methodologies. With standardized file formats being a prerequisite, ligand formats are designated as HETATM, with the website performing a format check. For added security, dual submissions, both via the website and email, are encouraged. As of April 2023, announcements include PZ40, PZ41, and PZ42, with PZ42 concluding submissions by September 20, 2023.
